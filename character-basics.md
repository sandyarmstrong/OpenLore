# Character Basics

## Character Basics

In OpenLore a character is defined not by race, class, or level, but by how they choose to invest their experience. Just as in life, every character is unique and they excel at what they invest in. Experience points are placed into specific Combat Proficiencies, representing skill developed as the result of hard training and practice in a specific combat skill. Experience points can also be invested into Tactical Conditioning,  representing grueling physical or mental training that the character has undergone to prepare for the challenges they will face.

Note also that a character's style in combat is completely separate from their personality and how they should be role-played. It is not necessary for a brawler to be a bumbling fool simply because he's strong. Characters are not defined by broad attributes, instead their skill in combat is defined by a collection of specific proficiencies and training, and their personality is whatever the players thinks it should be. The player is engaged in a cooperative storytelling experience and should treat their game characters as if they were characters in a book. 

Fundamentally, there are only 5 stats, these get more specific as you will see shortly but essentially these are this only 5 stats that matter in the game.

* Offensive Proficiencies
* Defensive Proficiencies
* Tactical Conditioning 
* Mechanical Proficiencies
* Rolloff Proficiencies

Each of these proficiencies is further divided into subgroups. might have one-handed proficiency or two-handed proficiency. Defense might have armor proficiency, or shield proficiency. The proficiencies below should work for most universe's without modification, so it is recommended to try this first and adjust for your lore and proficiencies accordingly.

The incredible thing about this system is it can be molded easily to the world you play in. See the game mastering portion of the handbook for more details on creating these for your universe.

{% hint style="info" %}
All proficiencies have a maximum of **10** points unless specified
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Using any equipment or magic without proficiency will give you an addition Nerf to your rolls on that proficiency, see Buffs and Nerfs in the combat and effect sections of this manual.
{% endhint %}

### Offensive Proficiencies

> The ability to deal damage.

Here are the offensive proficiencies, these work to help define your character and somewhat restrict being all knowing of everything. The reason we can have so many choices is because you can only use one offense.   


| Type | Min Range | Max Range | Combat Modifier Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Unarmed | 1 | 1 | Proficiency + Martial Training |
| One Handed Weapons | 1 | 1 | Proficiency + Weapon Quality |
| Duel Wield | 1 | 1 | Proficiency + Weapon Quality |
| Two Handed Weapons | 1 | 1 | Proficiency + Weapon Quality |
| Reach | 1 | 2 | Proficiency + Weapon Quality |
| Short Range | 3 | 5 | Proficiency + Weapon Quality |
| Medium Range | 5 | 8 | Proficiency + Weapon Quality |
| Long Range | 9 | 12 | Proficiency + Weapon Quality |
| Magic | 1 | 1-Spell Range | Proficiency  + Focus Quality  |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Range has a minimum and a maximum number of squares. A character cannot use a proficiency over the maximum at all, but can use it under the minimum with a Nerfed roll.

Spell Range is a byproduct of Mental Conditioning, see more about that below.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Hopefully you noticed the italic text in the magic, this is because this is specific to my own personal spell system we enjoy playing and will serve as a great example later when we talk about customization as a game master.
{% endhint %}

### Defensive Proficiencies

> The ability to defend yourself by any means.

Defense, like offense has some sub types that help create the whole picture of a characters defensive qualities. The only stat that matters in combat is 'Defense', all the other stats simply augment it. Defense can be adjusted as a proficiency or gained through use of equipment like shields and armor.

Defense is the skill by which you can defend yourself from damage, this combines together dodging, blocking,  parrying, the thickness of your armor, the smell of your breathe \(if that were to actually help\) 

| Type | Augment |
| :--- | :--- |
| Self-Defense | Proficiency + 8 + Armor Quality + Armor Class + Shield Class |
| Shield | Shield Access: Small 2, Large 4 |

The Class of Armor and Shield are static and will be discussed when we get to equipment. Armor is a byproduct of Physical Conditioning as it takes an immense amount of conditioning to be able to wear thick heavy armor. Shields have a Class bonus, but no Quality bonuses, see Equipment section for more details on this and why we had to do it this way.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Using armor or shields without proficiency will Nerf all your offensive proficiencies.
{% endhint %}

### Mechanical Proficiencies

> The ability to effect the mechanics of combat.

This is a good place to put skills that need some level of control. If adding to this area the skills would likely be: _Base + x Points up to y_

| Type | Augment |
| :--- | :--- |
| Movement | 3 +  2 squares per point up to 5 |
| Healing | 5 + 5 per point spent up to 7 |
| Martial Training | 1 per point spent up to 10 |

Marital Training is a great example of what mechanical proficiencies are about. Martial Training is put into place to grant effectively 'weapon quality' bonuses for unarmed. Without this being an unarmed martial artist would be entirely unfair as they would easily be surpassed by people finding better and better weapons. This mechanical fix is a good example of what to put here and fixes the mechanical deficiency that occurred by not using weapons.

### Tactical Conditioning

> A trained augmentation of potentially grouped proficiencies and a rolloff in the **Effect System**

Conditioning has two separate proficiencies that modify two very different types of characters. Melee and Magic characters are extremely different mechanically, these special conditioning proficiencies allow for this discrepancy to be fluid and obvious. Ranged characters could choose either to put points into either conditioning depending on if they wanted to lean more towards melee or magic outside of their ranged ability.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Taking a Conditioning Proficiency regularly of either flavor is recommended if you want to stay competitive long term, alternatively you will get beat down with Effects consistently.
{% endhint %}

| Type | Augment |
| :--- | :--- |
| Physical Conditioning | Armor Access: Light 3, Medium 5, Heavy 7 |
| Mental Conditioning | Spell Range Max: Melee 0, Reach 1, Short 3, Medium 5, Long 7 |

The augmented skills of these conditioning proficiencies are kind of like a bonus and a way to designate key attributes of a character that would require training and practice. The main purpose for conditioning is to be used as a rolloff in the Effect System. More on that later in the Combat section of the book, but for now I will say it is a direct augment to a rolloff of your conditioning vs theirs. 

For quick reference, effects occur by:

> Roleplay d20 + Best Conditioning vs. d20 + Best Conditioning

### Rolloff Proficiencies

> A rolloff proficiency are mini game based on a my proficiency vs your proficiency style

#### Grapple Proficiency

This is the only Core rolloff this book will provide and serves as both a solution to a common problem and an example of how a rolloff mini game might look like.

This rolloff mini game is for wrestling or grappling situation. The grappling system is simple. The rolloff mini-game rules are as follows:

* d20 + Grapple Proficiency vs. d20 + Grapple Proficiency
* Loser loses movement phase and action phase of combat
* Winner does not lose his current action phase, but does lose his movement phase
* Ties go to Winner
* Both combatants get **Minus** **Defense** \(Explained later in the Effect System\)

Each turn a grappling combatant has, the grapple is re-rolled, if the combatant with the current turn wins, he can take an action, if he loses, the next person in initiative order goes with no action taken.

Only the person who wins a grapple on their turn can use his action to stop grappling.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Zero proficiency does not provide a Nerf condition to Rolloff Proficiencies as they are mini games as such status would be stated specifically.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
A great additional example of a rolloff mini game might be a Poker Proficiency in a Wild West universe where you can specify winning and losing conditions to make it a little game within a game.
{% endhint %}

## Character Roleplay Elements

There are a few none statistical elements to a character that have ramifications on the game.

* Heroics
* Two Good at... Roleplay Elements
* Two Bad at... Roleplay Elements
* Background
* Personality
* Two Signature Moves
* Killable/NonKillable

Let me explain how each one of these can change the game.

### Heroics

Heroics is the ability to add a Double Boost to any type of proficiency for a single turn. The requirement for this is that you have to come up with something AWESOME that people will remember. Something graphic, or cool, or whatever you come up with, but it has to be memorable.

> I parkour over the pit on the wall, leap off and try to stab the archer in the eye with his own notched arrow.

That would be eligible for heroics in my opinion.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use heroics only once per game session and they do not carry over to the next game session.
{% endhint %}

### Traits

These are player written in fields that have effects on roleplay elements for the character. It will either give the Game Master a way to poke at your character with a Nerf or a Boost to a Roleplay Check \(more about Roleplay Checks later\)

Example:

* Bad at... Lying, Stutters only when lying
* Bad at... Jumping due to an accident that deformed the calf muscles
* Good at.. Detailed mechanical things and tinkering
* Good at.. Hearing due to the subtly needed to do the detailed mechanical work

In this example, if a situation were to come up \(by the game masters design, of course\) that the character had to jump over a pit, this character would get a Nerf on his roll to jump. But the same character, if needing to fix a lock in order to relock a broken door, he would get a Boost to attempting to fix the lock. 

More on Roleplay Checks later but this good at/bad at mechanic gives some dimension to your character and gives the Game Master some fun situations to play with for or against the party.

### Background

This should intentionally be fairly sparse at the beginning of the game, maybe a sentence. As the game goes on and your character divulges more about his past to the party this will become more dense with key content the Game Master and fellow players can use to feed off each other in roleplay. It is important to build this over multiple sessions, you dont know everything about a person by spending a short amount of time with them. It also allows the player himself to think about his character over multiple sessions time and design a solid background that he/she really feels connected to.

The background information will also become critical in a Game Masters decision making when it comes to the Roleplay Checks. A Game Master should read the backgrounds on a regular basis to understand what a character is and is not when making Roleplay Checks.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once background has been committed to a character, it cannot be undone, just like the past cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}

### Personality

Personality is just a simple comma separated list of one/two words that can be assumed are possible in roleplay situations even if the player is not currently acting as such in roleplay. These, like background should be exposed over time as the character evolves and the player's opinion of his own character evolves. Personality also acts as a reminder to the player of how he might act in situations.

Example: `Short Tempered, Kindhearted, Self-Driven` 

Like the background, the personality will have an impact on Roleplay Checks. A Game Master should review the Personality list of all in game players on a regular basis to keep Roleplay Checks fair.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once a personality trait has been committed to a character sheet it cannot be undone, most people's personality is what it is and cannot be changed.
{% endhint %}

### Signature Moves

These are two moves that you define who you are in combat, this is kind of like an easy button. Signature Moves can be used once per combat and get both damage and an effect. The definition of your signature move must pass Shenanigans before combat and must be assigned to your character sheet. Any changes to the Signature Moves must be roleplay added and pass Shenanigans to be changed. A character may only carry two signature moves, but only one may be used during an Encounter.

### Killable/NonKillable

A common issue for Game Masters is the moral dilemma to kill or not kill a character. It can hurt feelings, and some just dont care about feelings and will ignore this rule entirely. The way that I handle this is make it a player decision. 

#### Non-Killable

If you are not killable, death is a temporary inconvenience making for disallowed actions during combat, or the party needing to heroically save you from falling to your death. Basically if at any time your player were to die, the consequence is the party and Game Master have to roleplay you back to life again.

#### Killable

A killable character can be killed in both roleplay and in combat. This means actual death and rerolling a new character sheet. It is the Game Masters discretion how many points are given to the new character.

That being said there is a significant bonus to being killable, which is you get 3 points extra to spend as you see fit on your character.

### Experience

Experience can be granted for quests, for combats, for discovery, or accomplishing something. Experience is giving in points, for every 10 points you can buy a proficiency in whatever you choose. Unspent points should be tracked on the character sheet.

You can seek out training as well and pay for it in quests or gold. Find your dojo!
