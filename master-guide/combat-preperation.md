# Combat Preperation

## Creating Combatants

As a Game Master you will need to create enemies. OpenLore is different than most other systems in that we do not have a monster manual and we do not exhaustively list all of the enemies you could possibly face. OpenLore takes an a build your own approach to this problem and presents a system to design any mob you can imagine. Want a three headed watermelon spaghetti monster? You got it. Let me show you how with the table below \(also on the GM Reference Sheet\).

| Name | Difficulty | Experience Points | CM | Defense | Other Points |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Minor | 1 | 5-7 | 4 | 12 | 4 |
| Normal | 2 | 8-10 | 6 | 14 | 6 |
| Major | 3 | 11-13 | 8 | 16 | 8 |
| Brutal | 4 | 14-16 | 10 | 18 | 10 |
| Champion | 5 | 17-19 | 12 | 20 | 12 |
| Boss | 6 | 20-22 | 14 | 22 | 14 |
| Ancient | 7 | 23-25 | 16 | 24 | 16 |
| Legendary | 8 | 26-28 | 18 | 26 | 18 |
| DemiGod | 9 | 29-31 | 20 | 28 | 20 |
| God | 10 | 32 | 22 | 30 | 22 |

For this example let's say our party has three Experience 15 party members. As a GM I want this battle to be dynamic and somewhat difficult. Id like to make this a 2 on 3 combat. I need to pick two difficulties that when added together will be challenging to the party. Difficulty 4 would be balanced combat, so I am going to make one of my combatants a _Major Watermelon Sprout Monster_ and to make this challenging to the party of three I am going to make a _Champion Three Headed Watermelon Spaghetti Monster_.

The party should have a relatively easy time dispatching the _Major Watermelon Sprout_ but the champion will be very challenging for this party as they have favored numbers.

You will notice each of the combatants have CM and Defense already listed. The standard hit points are 40, so that is their starting point. The last thing to work on these two monsters is just Other Points. These points are meant to be put onto the various different combat skills like Grapple, Toughness, Aim, Tactics, Speed and First-Aid.

| Combatant | CM | Defense | Other Attributes | Abilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _Champion Three Headed Watermelon Spaghetti Monster_ | 12 | 20 | Tactics \[4\], Grapple \[6\], Toughness \[2\] | Can grapple two targets at once |
| _Major Watermelon Sprout Monster_  | 8 | 16 | First Aid \[2\], Speed \[3\], Aim \[3\] | None |

Using what you learned in the Building a Character section of the book you should see pretty quickly this is all you need for a character. Let's build the block we might use in the session content for these two monsters. _Notice on the Champion the CM is split between two attack types, this is a way to semi-nerf the more difficult enemy._

```text
Name: Champion Three Headed Watermelon Spaghetti Monster
Attack: Speghetti Slap + 4 [1d6+1d8], Bite + 8 [1d6+1d10]
Defense: 20 [1d6+1d8]
Health: 44 (2 toughness)
Combat: Grapple [6], Tactics [4], Effect Points [3]
Ability: Grapple two targets at once
```

```text
Name: Major Watermelon Sprout Monster
Attack: Plant Magic + 8 [1d6+1d10]
Defense: 16 [1d4+1d8]
Combat: Healing [11], Movement [6], Range [5]
```

These are complete, simple, diverse, and easily generated combatants. All of these stats were derived the same way they are done for the Combat Reference Sheet when building a character. I used a silly name to illustrate that it doesn't really matter what the combatant is. Using this method in OpenLore we can capture all imagination and not be burdened by a book full of stats. 

Notice the only parts that are listed are those that are not defaults. Knowing the defaults is critical but easy and helps keep the combatant blocks short and simple. 

| Stat | Default |
| :--- | :--- |
| Health | 40 |
| Effect Points | 1 |
| Movement | 3 |
| Range | 1 or 2 |
| Healing | 5 |

If you want to roll a character sheet you can do that too and make a specific build, but the model above is fast and easy on the GM. It produces well balanced combat so long as you stay close to the experience of the party.
