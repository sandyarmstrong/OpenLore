# Game Master Styles

## Game Master Responsibilities

The GM responsibilities are very similar in OpenLore to many other TTRPG games. This section of the book is to explore some of the discoveries and tips that have been found over the years of being a Master.  

A GM's job is simple really, make the game exciting and fun for the players. This is done by vividly drawing the theater of the mind, acting, and providing intensity. There is no one master that is identical to play with but there are three distinct types of GMs.

1. Creator Style - They want to create everything, the world, the map, the dialog, the plot, the lore
2. Lore Style - They make their own story/plots/dialogs within lore systems like Forgotten Realms
3. Adventure Style - Use premade content and story to dictate the game using other's writing

The most important rule about game masters is that they are always right and are the referee of the roleplaying game. When a decision needs to be made and a Game Master makes that decision, it takes effect and overrides all previous precedent set. OpenLore has been designed specifically to eliminate times debates about the rules take place. Simplified rules go a long way in reducing constant rule references needed in most other roleplay systems.

In OpenLore, a diplomatic decision can be made if there is contention with the Game Master's or other players decision. This diplomatic decision is called Shenanigans. See the Story and Roleplay section of the Player Guide for the Shenanigans rules.

The Game Master must control pace of the game at all times. A slow boring game is because the GM was not creating urgency or controlling the flow of the game. Dull combat is because the GM was not creating visualization and being strict about turn timing \(use it or lose it\). People should be excited and hooked to hear what is next.

Below, we will go through all the different aspects of GMing going from Creator to Lore to Adventure Style GMing. We start from Adventure Style because it is the most basic style.

## Adventure Style GMing

An Adventure Style GM takes content that is already written and runs the game to the plan of the author. When reading the content the GM should have accents, proper inflections, and pace. The adventure books from other systems can be used with OpenLore but things like roleplay checks and enemies will need to be calibrated to the OpenLore system.

These books are typically published with the lore books as add on content to increase sales. Forgotten Realms has them, LOTRs has them, Eberron has them... pretty much all campaign settings have the adventure books to go with them. You can find adventure content people have  written all over the internet as well.

When using adventure books you will want to make sure to read the entire session's worth of material and understand it fully before the game session. Players dont always follow the script and you will need to improvise in order to get them back on the script.

It is strongly recommended that all GM's spend time reading some of these Adventure Books even if you don't want to run a game with them. They will give you ideas on the style needed to predict players, add detailed descriptions and add dialog. You will learn from these Adventure Books that the writers place all of the relevant information in line when needed.

The responsibilities in this style are pretty limited as the content is already made. In OpenLore there will need to be some conversion of content that is within the Adventure Books. This is basically the only responsibility of the GM that plays in the Adventure Style

### Compatible Content

There are a handful of things in the many Adventure Books or online quests that will need to be converted to the OpenLore system. When you come across one of them you will simply create a compatible comparison in OpenLore. The list below are some of the things identified as needing converted in the materials. 

* Combatants - Anyone who the party will fight needs to be recreated for OpenLore
* Traps - These need to be adjusted for checks that range from 1-20 and reduced damage
* Roleplay - There is always roleplay that will need to be recreated to the OpenLore 1-20

See the next chapter of the book for details on creating combatants, traps, and roleplay checks.

## Lore Style GMing

The Lore Style GMs take an existing lore like Forgotten Realms or Star Wars and create the story within that universe. There is some variation in how much they use from the lore and how much they make, but the point of this style is to stay within a consistent pre-made lore, history, and paradigm.

GM's will most likely use the characters within the lore books to drive the story. These characters are usually very well integrated with the world so it is very easy to describe then and understand the hooks needed for storytelling. Game Mastering this way takes a lot of time to understand the nuances of the lore and the world they choose to make stories in. The pay off is best if the players choose to research the lore and can contribute to the integration of the world in they way the characters interact with the game.

Lore books \(Campaign Settings\) are rich texts that have tremendous detail on the history of the world, the key participants, the factions of the world, and a great deal of detail that provide easy hooks the GM can use when writing the story.

The majority of GMs play within this context as it it the best balance between creativity and world detail. If the players do the research in the world this is an extremely rich way to tell the story.

The Lore Style GM will need to convert the content in the lore books to OpenLore just like the Adventure GM. The GM will need to create monsters and enemies just like the Adventure Style GM. In addition to this there is story telling responsibilities. This GM style is much more time consuming than the previous Adventure Style.

### World Understanding

Understanding the lore in depth is key to the success of this style. The GM should be well versed in the Campaign Setting and understand the context of the story they are writing for. These campaign setting books typically are about 350 large format pages long and while you can get away with cherry picking here and there it is best to read them nearly cover to cover so you understand the full context of the world.

Once you have a solid understanding of the lore you can easily write content forever that hooks into that world. Most books have factions and religions that become hubs for quests and adventures. The main characters are spoon fed to you in the campaign settings books so it will be very easy to design plot and side quests around fully developed characters.

### Main / Side Quest Creation

Every campaign setting will have various levels of archetypes in them that will be very easy to hook into for the plot creation. Typically there will be main characters, places and general plot. It is up to the GM to hook the players.

Say the campaign setting I am prepping for has an evil villain named **Max**. In the book he is the leader of an undead religious cult by the name of **The Black Hand.** They are sending waves of undead beasts into the forest to scare people away from the **Temple of Denithor,** where they are hiding loot found on the people who are killed by the undead. There is a nearby town called **Carthen.**

The GM will create a plot and use this information provided from the campaign book. In this case maybe the GM will make a leading character in the town put out a reward to adventures willing to fight back the undead. The dialog for the quest will be created and the adventures will likely take on the quest. The responsibility of the GM is to generate the reason and/or reward for the party to participate in the adventure.

The only difference between a Main Quest and a Side Quest is if it is a long term plot based hook, or a short term, we could skip this type hook. Main Quests tend to be the save the world quest or whatever it might be. Side Quests are simply the extras along the way that provide good sub stories and enrichment.

### Places

Often times places in the campaign settings will be pretty general. **Carthen** might be simply described as a fishing town with hard working folk. **Temple of Denithor** might simply have a description that it was destroyed into ruins from the war a thousand years ago and once was a place of worship to the deceased god Denithor.

There is often little description or location maps in campaign settings and this becomes the responsibility of the GM to make the site maps or in the case of a town the merchants and accessible services. Major places in a campaign setting will sometimes have better descriptions of the cities, but often they are simply thematic and non-specific.

### Details

The Lore Style GM will be responsible for all the detail in the world. Campaign Settings are general and do not describe things in detail. Painting the theater of the mind is the most important job of a GM and it is in the details this occurs. Reading novels and good short stories will help you describe things in detail but I offer a simple example to illustrate this.

> You walk up to the ruins of the temple and see fragments of stone thrown about the site. The stone pile at the center of the temple is oddly untouched by nature.

Versus

> You walk up to the ruins of the temple and in all directions you see large stone fragments rise from the dirt. Three of the four corners of the temple still tower like monoliths of ancient architecture. Moss and vines have taken their course and make it difficult to see the original stone work behind them. Approaching closer to the center of the temple you see a large pile of rumble strangely untouched by nature; investigating these stones you see ancient carvings in them in repeating patterns.

As you can see there is vivid imagery by adding in just basic details. This detail can be refined more over time as you improve your writing style. Often times I will reference some artwork in pintrest and try my best to describe the image in words. This detailed writing makes a huge difference in the quality of the game for the players.

## Creator Style GMing

The final style to discuss is the Creator style GM. A creator is not interested in learning a whole bunch of premade lore and wants to write a world on his/her own. The GM will make an overworld map, make the cities, write a history relevant to the players and write a story within that world.

There are a lot of benefits in doing this style, the only downside is the players cannot research the world on their own. This style works really well for busy people who do not have as much time and cannot independently learn the lore. It is far less time consuming to just make the world up as you go than it is to study a pre-made world.

A GM in this style will typically not create everything exhaustively before hand. Typically in this style things get created as necessitated by the story. A fighters guild, for example may not exist at all until the GM writes it into the session description as a way to gather quests in one of his towns. This concept extends to the history of the world. The history is written as it is necessitated. World bosses are created as needed.

This style of GMing is surprisingly liberating in time consumption. The GM only needs to prepare his/her world from session to session and gets the freedom to literally do anything at all. Like the previous GM style, the Creator GM will need to write plot and side quests and describe places and details. The GM will need to create creatures and npcs to fight.

### Main Characters

Unlike with the campaign settings, the GM will need to create all the main characters on their own. There is a really great book out there called Masks, [https://www.enginepublishing.com/masks-1000-memorable-npcs-for-any-roleplaying-game](https://www.enginepublishing.com/masks-1000-memorable-npcs-for-any-roleplaying-game). This book has 1000 different main quality characters you can easily fit into your world. There is also endless content for character ideas online.

You only need a small handful of main quality characters in your story to carry you for a long time. This task is critical to your story. Luckily is it is also pretty simple to flesh out a character and make them integrated into the story.

### World Building

Within this style the GM will need to create the concept of the world. This world concept will define the races in the world, the heirarchy of power, the history and location of different elements. 

World building can be very fun if done in a minigame. Basically everyone draws an inch of the border or beach at a time. Once the border is complete you take turns defining what each blank area of the map contains. Let imagination run wild and you could result in a truly incredible overworld. Make sure to keep track of the details and make some cities and hamlets along the way.

More important than the overworld map is the world concept itself. What is the era, they world style, the basic history, and the different intelligent races that populate the world. How and why are monsters there? These are the questions that come to my mind when asking about the world. Is this a steampunk game, fantasy, high fantasy, sci-fi, modern, or cyberpunk game. What happened to steer the current state of the world?

This may sound difficult but starting is the key. Start with the concept and work the rest of the details out as you play sessions. The beauty of this style is you dont have to write it all at once. Take your time and mature the history as the party learns about it.
