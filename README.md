# Introduction to OpenLore

## Key Concepts about OpenLore

There are a few major concepts in the game that allowed us to make the many choices necessary in designing it.

* Roleplaying is the most important goal of the system.
* Creativity is the second goal, by allowing for highly creative actions from everyone.
* Third is the reduction of rules and math, making for less debate and rule checking.
* Lastly, most metagaming possibilities have been removed from the game.
* As a bonus, the core system is lore and universe agnostic.

**Metagaming** is the use of rules and stats to maximize the effectiveness of a character that goes against common sense and story continuity. This is unfavorable in roleplaying games because generally these decisions do not translate well to memorable and effective roleplay as a character. 

Metagaming also generally poses opposition to the game master and roleplay games are in reality a fully cooperative experience, not an us vs the game master type of game.

Example: A skinny hobbit fighter wields a great sword because the player likes that it has the most damage as a weapon, this doesn't really make sense, but some systems allow this to happen. 

Example: A sneaky character continuously hides under a table every turn because his stats allow him a sneak attack every turn if hidden. This is unrealistic as enemies would take notice.

## Why we made OpenLore..

This is the part most of you tune out, stay with me for a moment. We made this game accidentally by making "homebrew" adjustments to another role playing game. We improved one part at a time until we realized we didn't have any part of the original game left. Once we realized this, we started looking at several other roleplaying systems to try to see if we just accidentally made a game someone else made. What we discovered is that we had something unique and special. We hope you feel the same way about our role playing system and use it for many different stories.

## Tabletop Role Playing Game \(TTRPG\)

Tabletop RPGs have been around since the 1960's. Dungeons and Dragons being by far the most popular and recognizable version of the game style. To me, Tabletop RPGs are the best games in the world, mainly because there is no script, no coded path, no pre-destiny. It is the ultimate cooperative game of give and take. It is the most socially interactive and cerebral experience obtainable in any game. 

There are two distinct modes to the tabletop game

1. Story Mode
2. Combat Mode

The game is played by usually creating conflict in story and typically resolving said conflict in combat. Now the amazing thing is, it could just be story or just combat as well. The game is flexible and it all depends on how the Game Master decides to play his game. Most games are a hybrid of both but often times individual sessions will lean one way or the other for the majority of time.

A Game Master is essentially a god, he is the creator of the world, the society, the history, the people in the world \(NPCs\) other than the Player Characters \(PCs\). A Game Master controls the enemies and the ruthless king for example. The Game Master has ultimate authority on the game and how it is played and has the power to override the players at any time.  \(OpenLore has a specific system for this to happen in\)

Often times Game Masters rely on lore books like Forgotten Realms or Eberron to name a few from DnD to help with the world history and design. This is great if that is how your mind works; that is not how I master my world however. I choose to be free of the shackles of someone else's lore and design my own world with a mysterious history the players can unravel.

OpenLore, as it is in the name, lets you choose the lore for your game completely independently of the game rules. Pick the lore from World of Darkness or the Lord of the Rings or FireFly or anything your mind can dream of, and OpenLore simply just works.
