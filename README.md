# Introduction to OpenLore

## Key Concepts about OpenLore

There are a few major concepts in the game that allowed us to make the many choices necessary in designing it.

* Roleplaying is the most important goal of the system.
* Creativity is the second goal, by allowing for highly creative actions from everyone.
* Third is the reduction of rules and math, making for less debate and rule checking.
* Lastly, most metagaming possibilities have been removed from the game.
* As a bonus, the core system is lore and universe agnostic.

**Metagaming** is the use of rules and stats to maximize the effectiveness of a character that goes against common sense and story continuity. This is unfavorable in roleplaying games because generally these decisions do not translate well to memorable and effective roleplay as a character. 

Metagaming also generally poses opposition to the game master and roleplay games are in reality a fully cooperative experience, not an us vs the game master type of game.

Example: A skinny hobbit fighter wields a great sword because the player likes that it has the most damage as a weapon, this doesn't really make sense, but some systems allow this to happen. 

Example: A sneaky character continuously hides under a table every turn because his stats allow him a sneak attack every turn if hidden. This is unrealistic as enemies would take notice.

## Why we made OpenLore..

This is the part most of you tune out, stay with me for a moment. We made this game accidentally by making "homebrew" adjustments to another role playing game. We improved one part at a time until we realized we didn't have any part of the original game left. Once we realized this, we started looking at several other roleplaying systems to try to see if we just accidentally made a game someone else made. What we discovered is that we had something unique and special. We hope you feel the same way about our role playing system and use it for many different stories.
