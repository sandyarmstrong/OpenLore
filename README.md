# Introduction to OpenLore

## Key Concepts about OpenLore

There are a few major concepts in the game that allowed us to make the many choices necessary in designing it.

* Roleplaying is first class and integrated into all aspects of the game
* Creativity is a limitation of your mind, not the system
* Rules so simple you cannot negotiate them
* World and Universe are separated from the system

## Why we made OpenLore..

To be honest, we made this game accidentally by making "homebrew" adjustments to another role playing game. We improved one part at a time until we realized we didn't have any part of the original game left. Once we realized this, we started looking at several other roleplaying systems to try to see if we just accidentally made a game someone else made; what we discovered is that we had something unique and special. We hope you feel the same way about our role playing system and use it for many different stories.

OpenLore lets you choose the lore for your game completely independently of the game rules. Pick the lore from World of Darkness or the Lord of the Rings or FireFly or anything your mind can dream of and OpenLore simply just works. The structure of the OpenLore system is made to be flexible. You can make batman, a jedi knight, an elf, a cop, a high school student, an airship, a politician, or a special forces sniper without any adjustments to the rules.

The game is designed to simplify creation mechanics for both the player and the GM. These mechanics lower the burden of running a game and allows for unparalleled creativity in game.

When learning OpenLore it is best to eliminate expectations associated with other roleplay systems. This is harder for experienced veterans but important because this game takes a pretty drastic turn
