# Building a Character

## Character Sheet

The character sheet has a list of all the proficiencies and characteristics needed to play the game.  
[https://www.openloregames.com/charactersheet ](https://www.openloregames.com/charactersheet)for the latest version of the character sheet. There is one in the back of the book as well for printing purpose.

## Steps to Creation

1. Print the Character Sheet
2. Put your Name in the Player Name spot
3. Name your Character
4. Assign a Race if needed \(_Aesthetic with Lore Implications Only_\)
5. Set Health at 40
6. Toggle Killable/NonKillable
7. Assign 10 points to proficiencies
8. Get starter gear/equipment \(see below\)
9. Calculate Total Points \(see below\)
10. Write a one sentence backstory
11. Write 2-3 personality words
12. Assign two Good at... Traits and two Bad at... Traits
13. Come up with 2 Signature Moves and get them Shenanigans Approved

That's it. You are done!

### Starting Gear

You will be given 1000 gold to build your character. Each +1 item is 250g and a gear kit is 150g. In theory this means you will have three plus one pieces of equipment and a gear pack with 100g. There is no custom kits at Character Creation, just keep it simple, roleplay will provide plenty of opportunity to buy whatever you want.

| Dungeon Kit | Adventure Kit | Noble Kit | Buglar Kit | ??? Kit |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stuff | Stuff | Stuff | Stuff | Stuff |  |  |  |  |
| Thing | Thing | Thing | Thing | Thing |  |  |  |  |
| Neat | Neat | Neat | Neat | Neat |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Total Points

Total points is the amount of proficiency points your character has access to. You have two stats, the Distributed Points and an Actual Points per proficiency.

* Distributed Points are the points we put experience into \(1 Distributed Point / 10 Exp\)
* Actual Points is the number we use in combat after base number and armor bonus and weapon quality have been applied 
* Total points is the sum of all of your Distributed Points

#### Example

_A character with 3 defense points and 4 physical conditioning has light armor of some kind. This gives him/her +1 from the class of armor, and +1 from the quality of the armor on. This is a total of +2 to armor + 10 base + defense points = 15 defense. He/She also has 2 points in movement, giving her 7 movement total and lastly 5 points one handed weapon using a +1 quality weapon._

| _Proficiency_ | Distributed Points | Actual Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Defense | 3 | 15 |
| Movement | 2 | 7 |
| One Handed | 5 | 6 |
| Physical Conditioning | 4 | 4 |
| **TOTAL POINTS** | 14 | N/A |

This Total Points stat is used in balancing combat and assigning balanced loot rewards and combat experience rewards. It is a one time calculation that only changes when equipment or proficiencies change around. Simply recalculate the number each time you make changes to your character.
