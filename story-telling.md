# Story Mode

## What a Roleplaying Game is most...

It is a story, a tragedy, a fantastic adventure, a futuristic tale, a true to life epic... Roleplaying games at their core are really just a grand `Choose your own Adventure Book` inside the mind of the Game Master. It is the only game type you can make decisions that truly affect the story and truly have consequences. It is the only game style that is imagination driven where literally anything can happen.

## "I want to push the thingy mabober!"

Yes, that happens time to time in a roleplaying game and as such needs a mechanic to handle it and the many other scenarios that come up while playing out the diabolical plot the Game Master has provided. The roleplay check is the answer to all these story mode scenarios.

## Roleplay Checks

When you really want to do a thing and some stuff in OpenLore, there is a roleplay check that occurs to see if you pull it off. OpenLore takes a drastically different and simplified perspective on this key element to any roleplaying game. Rather than list every possible skill and track them, the Game Master simply assigns a number on a d20 that the player has to beat based on that character, his roleplay, and the context of the situation.

The real beauty about the system is it keeps the game under the Game Masters control, while still giving people the power to imagine and devise interesting characters and roleplay. The more roleplay context the Game Master can remember and the more familiar with the character personalities and backgrounds the more the Roleplay Check values will be favored. It could be as simple as the Game Master doesnt want you to go that route so describes the Roleplay Check high like a 20, but that is the thing...you still have a 5% chance to succeed.

Game Masters should review the Background, Personality, Traits, and Signature Moves of all the characters in the session before game time every game to ensure all of this comes into play in making Roleplay Check calls.
{% endhint %}

### The Pit Example 

`We have a character that claims he/she was athletic in the past and generally plays as if he/she were fit and capable athletically. The Game Master requires that the party needs to jump over a pit. The Game Master will announce "You must beat a 10" because you know, its kind of a big pit. The player then rolls an 11 on his/her d20 and successfully gets over the pit.   
  
The next character has not played athletic, has no history or reason why he would be good at jumping, is ready to make the jump over the same pit. Taking in the context of the situation, the Game Master states, "to jump the gap you must roll a 14" and the character rolls a lucky 15 to jump it.  
  
The last character that is up to jump the gap decides he is uninterested in the risk of insecurely jumping over the pit and spots a nice place to hook a grappling hook into the ceiling. He then claims he wants to simply swing over the gap. The Game Master takes this into context of how he/she feels about the situation and asks the player to see how well the grappling hook holds, and how well he can swing. The Game Master states, "You need to roll over a 5 to make sure the grappled rock holds your weight and you successfully make it over" but the player rolls a 3! indicating he was wrong about the sturdiness of the rock he grabbed with the hook.  
  
Now, suddenly, the party must action to save him via more roleplay checks like can the character catch the ledge once he starts to fall, can someone grab him mid air, etc etc until the situation is resolved or the killable character is dead at the bottom of the pit.`

### Good at.. Bad at.. Traits

This is also where the Good At and Bad At traits come in. If the context of the problem you are doing a Roleplay Check on is a good fit to match the Good At Trait, you get +2 on your Roleplay Check and if it is a good match for the Bad At Trait you get a -2 to your Roleplay Check. In the scenario above, had the first character specifically said he was "Good at jumping due to his long powerful legs", he would have gotten a +2 or maybe the character that fell had been "Good at Geology", that would have improved his assessment of the rocks he/she hooked and would have saved him with a +2.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to be truthful with your Bad At Trait, if you forget or ignore it and the Game Master notices you will automatically fail the roll.
{% endhint %}

The vast majority of Roleplay Checks are done without Traits, but the Game Master has the things you put into your Personality, your Background, and the way you simply roleplay at the table to go by in giving you favor or not in an unlimited amount of scenarios. The more you roleplay, the better the Game Master will naturally favor you in certain places. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
You cannot be good at everything, and Game Masters or fellow players will call Shenanigans if you try to roleplay far out of your comfort zone to get favor. Game Masters will also penalize your Roleplay checks if it is uncharacteristic of you, which means there is very little gain in trying.  
  
This is a social cooperative game and you will find that being concise with your character design will benefit you and let you enjoy the game more.
{% endhint %}

## Shenanigans

This is a rule put onto the game specifically for roleplay. Shenanigans is a rule put into place by which players can diplomatically and quickly resolve disagreements. The process is simple.

1. A player calls Shenanigans during the roleplay story mode part of the game
2. Play pauses and the caller of Shenanigans explains what he disagrees with in a sentence or two
3. The person who made the statement defends himself and his own logic in a sentence or two
4. The remaining people at the table get an opportunity to pitch a sentence or two
5. A vote is cast, Game Master is the tie breaker if needed

This rule is universal and can be used any time something "Doesnt seem to make sense" or "Doesnt seem lore appropriate" or "Doesnt make for a fun game" 

#### Example

_As a Game Master of a High Fantasy game I say "Then an atomic bomb goes off in the middle of Isaldor."_ _A player will very likely feel like that is lore inappropriate and just doesnt make sense, so he/she calls Shenanigans. The person says "There are not atomic weapons in our world, that doesnt make sense" and the Game Master say "I like atomic weapons though... " and the last player says, "Yah I dont think that makes sense, maybe it could be some magical explosion or something?" The players then take a vote and out vote the Game Master 2-1, the Game Master then must retract the Atomic Bomb Explosion from the story._

I use the Game Master example for a reason, the Shenanigans rule is effectively a cooperative rule to keep the game in a place that makes sense to the majority of people in the game. It is a method to help explain misqueues and things that may very well be an innocent misunderstanding.

Shenanigans can be used on any roleplay element of the game done by any person in the game, player and game master alike.
