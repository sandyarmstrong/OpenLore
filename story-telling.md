# Story Mode

## What a Roleplaying Game is most...

It is a story, a tragedy, a fantastic adventure, a futuristic tale, a true to life epic... Roleplaying games at their core are really just a grand `Choose your own Adventure Book` inside the mind of the Game Master. It is the only game type you can make decisions that truly affect the story and truly have consequences. It is the only game style that is imagination driven where literally anything can happen.

Story mode is when you are out of combat. This is where dialog occurs, puzzles, dungeoneering, purchasing, discovery, plot, etcetera occur. Story mode typically is about half a game session. The ratio of story vs combat is something a GM will handle in their own way. The combats that take place should make sense in the story context.

`"I want to push the thingy mabober!"`

Yes, that happens time to time in a roleplaying game and as such needs a mechanic to handle it and the many other scenarios that come up while playing out the diabolical plot the Game Master has provided. The roleplay check is the answer to all these story mode scenarios.

## Roleplay Checks

When you really want to do something in OpenLore, there is a roleplay check that occurs to see if you pull it off. OpenLore takes a drastically different and simplified perspective on this key element to any roleplaying game. Rather than list every possible skill and track them, the Game Master simply assigns a number on a d20 that the player has to beat based on the 'average person' in the world and the context of the situation.

The real beauty about the system is it keeps the game under the Game Masters control, while still giving people the power to imagine and devise interesting characters and roleplay. The max difficulty of a situation is 20, and the lowest is 1. In other words, you get a 5% chance to fail or succeed outlier conditions even when you are just average at a task.

Roleplay Skills \(see Building a Character\) are a way for characters to be better than average at something and they add directly to the d20 roll in attempt to beat the 'average' difficulty set by the GM.

### The Pit Example 

`We have a character that has 4 points in Jumping. The Game Master requires that the party needs to jump over a pit. The Game Master will announce "You must beat a 10" because you know, its kind of a big pit. The player then rolls an 8 on his/her d20, adds her 4 points in Jumping and successfully gets over the pit.   
  
The next character has no such additional skill in Jumping. He too is required to jump over the pit, rolls 11 on his dice, adds nothing to his roll, and still succeeds to beat the 10 roll required by the GM.  
  
The last character that is up to jump the gap decides he is uninterested in the risk of insecurely jumping over the pit and spots a nice place to hook a grappling hook into the ceiling. He then claims he wants to simply swing over the gap. The Game Master takes this into context of how he/she feels about the situation and asks the player to see how well the grappling hook holds, and how well he can swing. The Game Master states, "You need to roll over a 5 to make sure the grappled rock holds your weight and you successfully make it over" but the player rolls a 3! indicating he was wrong about the sturdiness of the rock he grabbed with the hook.  
  
Now, suddenly, the party must take action to save him via more roleplay checks until the situation is resolved or the killable character is dead at the bottom of the pit.`

## Shenanigans

Shenanigans is a rule put into place by which players can diplomatically and quickly resolve roleplaying disagreements. The process is simple.

1. A player calls Shenanigans during the roleplay story mode part of the game
2. Play pauses and the caller of Shenanigans explains what he disagrees with in a sentence or two
3. The person who made the statement defends himself and his own logic in a sentence or two
4. The remaining people at the table get an opportunity to pitch a sentence or two
5. A vote is cast, Game Master is the tie breaker if needed

This rule is universal and can be used any time something "Doesnt seem to make sense" or "Doesnt seem lore appropriate" or "Doesnt make for a fun game" 

#### Example

_As a Game Master of a High Fantasy game I say "Then an atomic bomb goes off in the middle of Isaldor."_ _A player will very likely feel like that is lore inappropriate and just doesnt make sense, so he/she calls Shenanigans. The person says "There are no atomic weapons in our world, that doesnt make sense" and the Game Master says "I like atomic weapons though... " and the last player says, "Yah I dont think that makes sense, maybe it could be some magical explosion or something?" The players then take a vote and out vote the Game Master 2-1, the Game Master then must retract the Atomic Bomb Explosion from the story._

I use the Game Master example for a reason, the Shenanigans rule is effectively a cooperative rule to keep the game in a place that makes sense to the majority of people in the game. It is a method to help explain miscues and things that may be an innocent misunderstanding.

Shenanigans can be used on any roleplay element of the game done by any person in the game, player or  game master alike.
