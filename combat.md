# Combat Mode

## Player Roles in Combat

You thought you could just be a player with no responsibility didnt you? OpenLore has a concept that helps the flow of combat that requires the players to do a little more then simply wait for their turn.

1. A Controller will control the bad guys and what they do
2. A Record Keeper will keep track of what effects are active on whom
3. All other players will share the role of Narrarator, who's role will be to create urgency and combat visualizations

### The Controller

This is typically the Game Master. The responsibility is to choose attacks, effects, movements and strategy that will give the characters a challenge. The Controller will have access to the NPC Difficulty Charts \([https://www.openloregames.com/DifficultyChart](https://www.openloregames.com/DifficultyChart), also later in the Game Master Guide\) and he will be responsible for taking the right statistics off the Difficulty Chart and applying them to in game attacks and effects. The Controller controls the enemies movement and actions.

### The Record Keeper

This is possibly the second most important role in combat. The record keeper writes down the combat initiative order, keeps track of whose turn it is, how much damage they have taken, and what effects are currently active on them or not. There is a blank sheet you can use to do this. 

I recommend using colored paper under the figurines or some way to generically track your enemies, if you have a million figurines this may not be needed but most of us have a handful and they dont always look like Stirges when you want them to.

The blank sheet can be found at \([https://www.openloregames.com/RecordKeeper](https://www.openloregames.com/RecordKeeper)\) or attached to the back of this book with the Character Sheet

### The Narrator/s

The narrator job is meant to keep combat vivid and fast. The narrator describes the misses, the crushing blows, and the storming monster. The narrator creates intensity and excitement and demands that combat move as quickly as possible. It is the narrator's responsibility to keep time and make things seem urgent. He could say things like "Your running out of time the Bugbear is charging you" and things to that effect that make combat intense instead of methodical.

The narrator might interject something interesting into the enemies in response to the way the Game Master has played them like "The orc that isnt attacking us is simply picking his nose and looking for something" these could turn into really great roleplay scenarios that the Game Master didnt think of and makes it so there is interesting cooperative play.

I recommend the narrator keep track of turn time and the Game Master implement a combat timer with a repeating time limit and abide by a use it or lose it turn policy. The turn time threshold will depend on your players capabilities, but it should be very consistent regardless of how long it is. Spare time is just extra time for the next person.

> Simple Repeating Timer is free on iOS and I am sure you can find one easily on Android

{% hint style="info" %}
Shenanigans or a rule question will pause the timer and the combat, this should be very limited and out of game conversations with a player having trouble may be necessary to facilitate better and more memorable combat
{% endhint %}

## Stages of Combat

1. Initiative
   * d20 is rolled for every character and enemy to provide combat order
2. Turns
   * A turn consists of 3 stages
     * Movement \(up to you movement speed\)
     * Action \(you do something\)
     * Resolution \(resolve any effects\)
   * Movement and Action can be swapped, but Resolution must always occur at the end
   * You can choose to sacrifice your action for an additional movement phase
3. Rounds
   * A round is a total of 5 seconds of game time
   * A round is how long it takes for everyone to complete a turn once
4. Loot
   * Players like loot, Game Masters should give it to them

### Initiative

This one is pretty simple, everyone rolls a d20 including all characters/enemies and the order is written down on the Record Sheet by The Recorder. If there is a tie in numbers an additional roll takes place to assign order at the previous location in initiative. There is no modifiers to this stage as we wanted to keep this part of combat as easy as possible without math.

#### Example

`The initiative rolls as follows:  
14,8,8,4  
  
If the tie breaker roll is 18 and 3, the winner of the tie goes after the 14 and the loser goes after the other tie breaker, then lastly the character with the original 4 would go.`

### Turn

So its your turn? I bet you want to do something, here is how it shakes out.

1. Move up to your move speed
   * You can do this after your action as well. 
   * You can also use your action for a second move phase. 
   * Most of the time it is Move then Action
2. Action
   * Choose Damage or Effect
   * Describe what you are doing
   * Roll for results
3. Resolve Effects, this is more of a job for the Record Keeper, but on this stage he/she removes a counter for any effects you have in place. The Record Keeper also will put new effects in place and tracks any damage you have done during your turn

### Round

A round is basically nothing more then a unit of time. Many effects will last for 2 rounds for example. A round is the amount of time taken to give everyone a turn. Having turns be time kept by a Narrator will help keep rounds and combat mostly a consistently predictable amount of time.

### Loot

Experience is a very important reward that is given during combat. There will be more about assigning proper difficulty enemies and the point system in the Game Master Guide. You will be given XP based on the difficulty of the combat as follows:  
`Points Difference = Total Points of Party - Total Points of Enemies`

| Point Difference | XP |
| :--- | :--- |
| &gt;10 | 0 |
| &gt;5 | 1 |
| -5 to 5 | 2 |
| &lt;-5 | 3 |
| &lt;-10 | 4 |

This keeps going to up by intervals of -5

Other than experience an item worth 10x each enemy total points will be provided. The Game Master should keep this repeatable and simple and stick with gems, jewelry, items, alchemical ingrediants and things of that nature and simply assign a 10x value to them.

#### Example

_A party of three 20 point characters goes against three 23 point enemies. If the party \(40 point total\) wins against the \(46 point total\) they will get 3 XP each and something worth 230 each._ 

This is very similar to quest loot and gifts which will be 10x the player point totals when rewarded, see Game Master Guide for more detail on how to delegate treasure.

## Damage System

I bet you want to be able to do some damage in combat? Well it is a good thing we have Offensive Proficiencies then. Let me tell you how easy this is.

1. Roll your damage proficiency of choice, say a ShortBow
2. Check if the total is equal or higher then defense of target
3. If the check passes, apply the dice combo without modifiers to the target

### Roll Proficiency

In order to roll damage for a ShortBow, which is a Medium Range Weapon, I need to roll:  
`1d8 + 1d12 + Medium Range Proficiency`

For this working example lets say I have a Medium Range Actual Proficiency of 5, this means that if the 1d8 rolls a **`4`** and the 1d12 rolls a **`10`**, my total for the roll would be 19.

### Is Target Hit?

In the last example I rolled **`4`** and **`10`** + 5 proficiency, lets stick with that. Say the target defense is 18.  
19 is greater than 18, so this is considered a hit and will cause damage.  
  
Ties go to offense.

### How Much Damage?

Lets reference the two dice again, the d8 is a **`4`** and the d12 is **`10`**. Simply add these two together \(Without the +5!\) totaling at **14** damage dealt. . . that's it. One roll of two dice.

## Effect System

The best way to describe effects is through a few examples, and we can break them down after some simple explanation of the Effect System rules.

1. To roll any effect, you must pass a roleplay check
2. You must select which conditioning, mental or physical will be used by you \(likely the highest\)
3. You roll a d20
4. If you pass the roleplay check, that number + your conditioning of choice is your total
5. The enemy rolls d20 + his conditioning of choice for defense
6. If defender wins, the effect does nothing
7. If offense wins, the effect takes effect in one of two durations
   * Concentration
   * 2 rounds

### Effects List

| Effect | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Defense + | Opponent gets Nerf on Proficiency Rolls |
| Defense - | Opponent get Boost on Proficiency Rolls |
| Offense + | Target gets Boost on Proficiency Rolls |
| Offense - | Target gets Nerf on Proficiency Rolls |
| Conditioning + | Target gets Boost on Conditioning Rolls |
| Conditioning - | Target get Nerf on Conditioning Rolls |
| No Movement | Target cannot use movement phase \(**Nerf to Offensive Conditional Roll**\) |
| No Action | Target cannot use action phase \(**Nerf to Offensive Conditional Roll**\) |
| Push/Pull 1 Square | Target moved one square in Offensive decided direction |

### Concentration

Concentration is decided by the Game Master or requested by the Player. If a concentration condition is in place the effect \(see next section on list of effects\) will get an addition Nerf or Buff. 

* The person concentrating on the effect cannot do a Movement Phase during his/her turn. 
* The person effected by it will have a chance to rolloff conditions again at the end of his/her turn to try to break concentration. 
* Concentration can be broken by causing damage to the person in control of the concentration
* Concentration can be broken by the person in control at will

#### Ally Concentration Example

_A mage type character wants to boost his ally next to him with Defense + for as many rounds as he can concentrate. Since this is an ally, there is no rolloff and the effect just happens. The result of the effect is Defense ++ or more specifically Opponents attacking the Double Boost Defense will get a - 4 on their attack proficiency. This will take place until the Mage decides to stop, the mage cannot move during that time and cannot take any other action. The mage must also pass a Roleplay Check since this is an effect._

#### Opponent Concentration Example

_A fighter type character wants to hold his hand over an opponents eyes from behind them to lower their Defense. The fighter specifies he/she wants to use concentration, or the Game Masters specifies it will be Concentration. The Roleplay Check is set to 5 since the fighter is in a good position to do this, the roll for the fighter is most likely going to be `d20 + Physical Conditioning`   If the d20 is over 5, and the total with the Physical Conditioning beats a `d20 + Conditioning` of the opponent the effect goes into place.  
  
Since this is a Concentration Effect, the end of next turn of the opponent, there is an additional `d20 + Conditioning` rolloff to see if the opponent can break from the effect. The fighter cannot move during this concentration. The effect stays in place until the fighter takes damage or the opponent rolls out of the effect on his turn._

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is the job of the Record Keeper to inform players when these concentration rolloffs need to take place and to track the activation and deactivation of these effects.
{% endhint %}

### Two Rounds

Many effects just happen \(like throwing sand in the enemies eyes to nerf defense\) will have just a 2 round duration. This is mostly for simplicity and fairness. The Record Keeper is responsible for tracking these rounds.

### Compound Effects

It is possible to do multiple effects in a single attempt, for each additional effect, say doing No Movement and No Action together, there would be an extra Double Nerf on your roll to accomplish the effect. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
The No Movement, No Action example here would be a Quadrupal Nerfed roll on a single opponent due to the extra Nerf on No Movement and the extra Nerf on No Action. If this had been Defense - Offense - for 2 rounds here instead, it would have just been the Double Nerf for being a compound effect.
{% endhint %}

It is not possible to do damage and an effect outside or Signature Moves.

##  Range Rules

Range is defined a the number of adjacent contiguous squares between you and the target. The square you stand on only counts if it is needed for the range to be contiguous and you would take the ramifications of the action taking place withing that range.   
  
Area is simply the number of specified targets within your contiguous range.

Other than Magic, Range is static see Character Basics on Proficiencies for specifics.  
A character can use a weapon in a range lower than the static range for the cost of a Nerf.

| Type | Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unarmed | 1-1 |
|  |  |
| One Handed | 1-1 |
| Duel Wield | 1-1 |
| Two Handed | 1-1 |
| Reach | 2-2 |
|  |  |
| Short Range | 3-5 |
| Medium Range | 5-8 |
| Long Range | 9-12 |
|  |  |
| Magic | 1-Spell Range \(see Mental Conditioning\) |

{% hint style="danger" %}
A character cannot use a weapon over the Maximum range specified on the proficiency.
{% endhint %}

## Area Rules

Area can be used by melee, ranged or magic means with a roleplay check and a Nerf per additional target over the first. Area takes place only within weapon range and can be used for both damage and effects.

### Effect Area Example

_A mage type character want to lower the defense of three targets within his range for two rounds. The mage effect roll for this would be `d20 + Conditioning - double nerf`   
  
The - 4 is because the area attack has 3 targets, the first one is not nerfed and each additional target gets nerfed, which means that the Condition Rolloff for the mage is Double Nerfed. Each defender gets an individual roll to counter the lower defense._

_The Game Master specifies the roleplay check for this action is 5.  
  
In this example lets say that the Mage rolls a 10 \(passing roleplay check\), has 6 Mental Conditioning and a - 4 double nerf... that is a total of 12 to beat, now say the 3 opponents roll and total to 10,18, and 8. The 10 and 8 get the Defense - for 2 rounds, the 18 has nothing happen._

### Damage Area Example

_A reach proficiency wants to hit four people with one sweeping swing of his halberd. His roll would be:_`1d12 + 1d8 + proficiency - triple nerf and a d20 for roleplay check`

_The Game Master say the roleplay check is 14 due to difficulty. Say he/she rolls an 18 on d20 passing the roleplay check, rolls a 6 on the d12, a 4 on the d8, has 10 reach proficiency and a triple nerf of  - 6. The total attack roll on all 4 opponents would be 6+4+10-6=14, if the opponents defense is 12,16,18, and 22, the only opponent he does the 10 \(just the d12 and d8\) damage to is the opponent with 12 defense._

_In this example had one of the foes been under the 2 to 2 range of the Reach Weapon \(Halberd\), the area attack would have been a quadrupal nerf, or - 8 instead of a - 6._

As can see area of effect gets Nerfed pretty quickly, but it can devastating on a solid roll. The biggest risk is it does nothing, which means nothing happened on your turn. Its a big risk to take, big risk, big reward.

## Movement Rules

You can move once a turn, or twice a turn if you choose to sacrifice your action. Fleeing is simple double movement each turn until you have reached safety or Game Master discretionary distance away from the opponents. Movement has a low base of three to incentive the movement proficiency. It really does make a big impact in combat.

## Magic!

Im sure you have asked by now, "But where is the spellbook? How do I know what spells I can use?" OpenLore has an open ended answer. It is whatever spell you want.  
  
"I want to grow vines around your feet so you cannot move"  
"I want to spray steam in your eyes so you cannot defend yourself"  
"I am going to call down a meteor to strike you down and do damage."  
"I am going to create a strong gravity field above you to pull you up, then turn it off so you fall and take damage"

You should see at this point that all of those things are easily handled by OpenLore

Vines = Effect System  
Steam = Effect System  
Meteor = Damage System  
Gravity Field = Damage System

There are some things you cannot mold easily to the system like teleportation and conjuring, but if that is important to you, it would be easy to add a proficiency and some simple guidelines around these.

The vast majority of creativity in magic is just the how, not so much the what. It is incredible what people come up with when the How is not restricted to a card description.

{% hint style="info" %}
In my game, as will be described more in the Game Master portion of this book, we use a magical forms system where you have to learn about the plant form or the fire form and you stay within the forms you know. This is simply just to make it so there is a sense of growth in magic and a restraint on imagination to some extent.
