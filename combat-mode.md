## Player Roles in Combat

You thought you could just be a player with no responsibility didn't you? OpenLore has a concept that helps the flow of combat that requires the players to do a little more then simply wait for their turn.

1. A Controller will control the bad guys and what they do
2. A Record Keeper will keep track of what effects are active on whom and how much damage has been taken
3. All other players will share the role of Narrator, who's role will be to create urgency and combat visualizations

### The Controller

The Controller is responsible for controlling the enemies in combat. This is typically the Game Master. The controller must choose attacks, effects, movements, and strategy that will give the characters a challenge. The Controller will have access to the NPC Difficulty Charts \([https://www.openloregames.com/DifficultyChart](https://www.openloregames.com/DifficultyChart)\) and he will be responsible for taking the right statistics off the Difficulty Chart and applying them to in game attacks and effects. The Controller controls the enemies movement and actions.

### The Record Keeper

The record keeper is responsible for tracking initiative, damage, and effects during a combat encounter. The Record Keeper writes down the combat initiative order, keeps track of whose turn it is, how much damage they have taken, and what effects are currently active on them or not. There is a blank sheet you can use to do this. 

I recommend using colored paper under the figurines or some way to generically track your enemies, if you have a million figurines this may not be needed but most of us have a handful and they dont always look like Stirges when you want them to. You will still need to identify which figurine is which among similar types. Cut construction paper is perfect for this.

The blank sheet can be found at \([https://www.openloregames.com/RecordKeeper](https://www.openloregames.com/RecordKeeper)\) and attached to the back of this book with the Character Sheet

### The Narrator/s

The narrator is responsible for narrating the combat as it takes place, this is meant to keep combat vivid and fast. The narrator describes the misses, the crushing blows, and the storming monster. The narrator creates intensity and excitement and demands that combat move as quickly as possible. It is the narrator's responsibility to keep time and make things seem urgent. He could say things like "Your running out of time the Bugbear is charging you" and things to that effect that make combat intense instead of methodical.

The narrator might interject something interesting into the enemies in response to the way the Game Master has played them like "The orc that isnt attacking us is simply picking his nose and looking for something" these could turn into really great roleplay scenarios that the Game Master didnt think of and makes it so there is interesting cooperative play.

I recommend the narrator keep track of turn time and the Game Master implement a combat timer with a repeating time limit and abide by a use it or lose it turn policy. The turn time threshold will depend on your players capabilities, but it should be very consistent regardless of how long it is. Spare time is just extra time for the next person.

> Simple Repeating Timer is free on iOS and I am sure you can find one easily on Android

## Stages of Combat

1. Initiative
   * d20 is rolled for every character and enemy to provide combat order
2. Turns
   * A turn consists of 3 stages
     * Movement \(up to you movement speed\)
     * Action \(you do something\)
     * Resolution \(resolve any effects\)
   * Movement and Action can be swapped, but Resolution must always occur at the end
   * You can choose to sacrifice your action for an additional movement phase
3. Loot
   * Players like loot, Game Masters should give it to them

### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat encounter all combatants roll a d20. The initiative order is written down on the Record Sheet by The Recorder. If there is a tie between two initiative rolls the players can decide what order they go in, even if it gives the players an advantage.

### Turn

So its your turn? I bet you want to do something, here is how it works.

1. Move up to your move speed
   * You can do this before or after your action. 
   * You can choose to use your Action to Move again 
2. Action
   * Choose Damage or Effect
   * Describe what you are doing
   * Roll for results
3. Resolve Effects, this is more of a job for the Record Keeper, but on this stage, remove a counter for any effects that expire.

### Loot
Loot is handled very differently in this system to make it easier on GMs. The quality of the loot is based on the experience of the enemies but the items, unless obvious, are determined by the players.

|Difficulty|Quality|Modifier|Total Gold Value|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|Worn|1|100|
|2|Standard|2|200|
|3|Well-Made|3|300|
|4|Fine|4|400|
|5|Military|5|500|
|6|Superior|6|600|
|7|Exquisite|7|700|
|8|Masterwork|8|800|
|9|Legendary|9|900|
|10|Godly|10|1000|

With the way the game is balanced it doesnt matter as much if character gets the items they want in combat and it is less of a burden on the GM to worry about loot. These items could be jewels, gold, alchemical ingredients, furs, weapons, armor, really whatever so long as it makes sense for the combatant.

If the GM specifies that someone is fighting with chain mail and a giant mace, it's obvious what the items are, but if nothing is obvious it defaults to the players choice of items upon GM approval.

The _Total Gold Value_ of the loot cannot be exceeded per enemy.

#### Example

```
A three character party fights a difficulty 4 dark ranger with a red longsword and his difficulty 3 rabid wolf. The party defeats them. The red longsword is obvious, and is of Fine quality based on the difficulty of the enemy, but the wolf is more difficult. One party member will take the Fine Red Longsword and the other two members split loot from the wolf.

Those remaining two party members decided the fangs are worth 50g and the fur is worth 150g. Each takes a part of the rabid wolf.
```

As you can see in the example, it doesnt really matter what loot the party gets, so long as it makes sense and stays within the particular value. If a GM wants to regulate the items, he should do so by describing the items in combat more to make it obvious what is available.

## Treasure and Quest rewards

Treasure and Quest rewards work the exact same way as loot in combat, but is based on the highest experience character in the party. Refer to the Suggested Individual Player Loot by Experience table.

## Damage System

I bet you want to be able to do some damage in combat? Here is how it works:

1. Refer to the Combat Reference Sheet you created in Building a Character
1. Roll your damage proficiency of choice, say a Longsword
2. Check if the total is equal or higher than defense of target
3. If the check passes, apply the dice combo without modifiers to the target as damage

### Roll Proficiency

In order to roll damage for a Longsword, you need to roll the Combat Dice for Longsword, say 
`1d6 + 1d10`

For this working example lets say you have a Longsword Combat Modifier of 5, this means that if the 1d6 rolls a **`4`** and the 1d10 rolls a **`10`**, my total for the roll would be 19.

### Is Target Hit?

In the last example you rolled **`4`** and **`10`** + 5 CM. Say the target defense is 18.  
19 is greater than 18, so this is considered a hit and will cause damage.  
  
Ties go to offense.

### How Much Damage?

Lets reference the two dice again, the d6 is a **`4`** and the d10 is **`10`**. Simply add these two together \(without the +5 CM\) totaling at **14** damage dealt.
