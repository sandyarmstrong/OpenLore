# Advanced Combat

## Effect System

The effect system is how non-damage things occur in combat. This could be as simple as throwing dirt in the opponents eyes, or as complicated as a magical goo that slows your arms from moving well in combat. The effect system is dependent on creativity and with that creativity is extreme flexibility.

Effect Points are used to build effects from your Tactical score. The more Tactical your character, the more he will be able to leverage situations that cause effects.

### Tactics

Tactics are the foundation of the effect system. Tactics are used directly in the effect system by adjusting a rolloff against enemies. `d20+Tactics v. d20+Tactics` is what determines if your effect against an enemy takes place.

### Effect Points

The effect system works by creating effects with a point buy system. Effects can be used every turn if desired. The points are calculated with `Tactical / 2 round down + 1` A tactics score of 3 would have 2 Effect Points to spend creating the effect desired.

</table>Something to notice in the table above is that not all effects last the same amount of time, nor cost the same amount of points. This is because the phase effects are significantly more debilitating than the others. Taking away a little speed does not take all of it like movement phase does.

Buffs will not require any kind of check on them to have an effect on allies. Due to this ease of casting there is a -2 Effect Point penalty to ally buffing vs enemy debuffing.

Example

`A character with 4 tactics has 3 Effect Points. He wants to buff his allies' attack by 3 but cannot due to the -2 penalty to buffing. The only way for him to do this is to concentrate (see below) to add the 2 effect points. Another way for him to do this without concentrating is to effect the enemy defense instead. Doing this against the enemy does not have the -2 penalty to Effect Points, but you must win a tactical rolloff to have the effect go into place.`

### Concentration

Notice in the table above that there is an option for concentration on the effects. Every time you concentrate on an effect you will lose the next turn's movement phase, but the effect lasts until you get hit or stop concentrating on the effect. In addition to it lasting as long as desired, it also adds 2 effect points to your pool to spend. Lets summarize:

* Ends when you desire the effect to end
* Ends when you get hit
* Lose the next movement phase
* Must use action phase to continue concentration
* Add 2 effect points to your pool when cast
* Each turn effected enemies can do a tactical rolloff to try to break concentration`d20+Tactics v. d20+Tactics`

In the example in the last section, if the character had chosen to concentrate on lowering the defense of the enemy rather than increase the attack of his ally he would have had 5 effect points to change defense with instead of just 3.

The upside to concentration is you get more power, the downside is you have no guarantee how long it may last. It is best to weigh your opinions to pick lower effect power for guaranteed duration of 1 or 2 rounds, or concentrated effects that are more powerful but have no guarantee length.

### Effect Duration

Duration is counted in rounds. Rounds are the number of times the target ends his turn. If an effect has 2 rounds, it means the target must complete his turn two full times before the effect wears off. This is the job of the Record Keeper in combat to track this as mentioned above. The resolution phase of combat is when the effects resolve and drop from the character.

## Multiple Targets

Area and multiple targeted damage or effects are dealt with very simply in OpenLore. You simply divide the damage if you hit or divide the effect points if succeeded. The key element is it needs to make roleplay sense and the GM has the option to call Shenanigans and bring it to a vote.

The reason this method works so well arbitrarily is because the total effect or damage to the battlefield is the same regardless of how you distribute them. This gives the appeal of area without the overage in damage or effect imbalance.

### Multitarget Damage

Choose as many targets as you want in your range, so long as the attack makes sense, roll your Combat Dice once, if the Combat Dice is over the defense you can distribute the damage as you wish between combatants that you beat the defense on.

Example

`Three targets are in range of your Halberd Polearm. You make a sweeping knee high attack on all three and roll Combat Dice totaling 14 with a +3 CM totaling an attack of 17. You beat two of the three targets who only had 15 defense, the third target had 20 defense. Of the two that were hit, you distribute the 14 damage how you see fit.`

### Multitarget Effects

Very similar to damage, you roll a single Tactical roll for yourself and each chosen target must roll Tactical as well. If you hit multiple targets you distribute the Effect Points to those multiple targets as you see fit.

Example

`Three targets are in range of your Halberd Polearm. This time you are going to use the halderd to target the torso of each opponent with the objective of cutting the straps on the armor. You spin and aim at three opponents again, roll your tactical roll of say 17. You effect two of the three opponents and distribute all effect points how you wish across those two opponents you beat. Say -2 defense on the first and -1 defense on the second for two rounds.`

##  Ganging Up

When two melee characters are adjacent to the same enemy character either one of them can declare they are Ganging Up on that enemy. This can be done out of turn. The two characters will get a + 2 to their Attack against that enemy until one of them leaves or changes targets. You must declare you are Ganging Up so that it is obvious when a character changes targets.

If two melee characters are already Ganging Up on an enemy, a ranged character can join into the group and declare they are Ganging Up on the enemy. The ranged character would get the same +2 as the melee characters, the only difference is a ranged character cannot initiate the Ganging Up.

## Multiple Attacks per Action

In OpenLore you have the option to use multiple attacks in a single action. For each interval of 5 Combat Modifier \(5, 10, 15 and 20\) you will get an additional attempt to beat the enemy defense. Each of these attempts will be at a -5 Combat Modifier until you go below zero. 

These rules soften the blow of missing and make it so there is a progression in combat as you gain experience. Reference your Combat Reference Sheet for this data in the Multiple Attacks per Action table.

Examples:

`A Combat Modifier of +8 would result in two attempts, one at Combat Modifier of +8 and the second attempt of a Combat Modifier of +3`

`My character has a Combat Modifier of 11, this means I get 3 attempts to beat the enemy defense with a Combat Modifier of +11 on the first Combat Dice roll, +6 on the second attempt at the Combat Dice roll and +1 on the final attempt to hit the enemy.` 

| Combat Modifier \(CM\) | Number of Attacks | CM per Attack |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 1 | 3 |
| 4 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 2 | 5 / 0 |
| 6 | 2 | 6 / 1 |
| 7 | 2 | 7 / 2 |
| 8 | 2 | 8 / 3 |
| 9 | 2 | 9 / 4 |
| 10 | 3 | 10 / 5 / 0 |

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a character gets a boost to CM, this could change the number of attacks currently accessible. The easiest way to manage this is to just subtract 5 from your CM until you cant anymore.
{% endhint %}

## Defensive Stance / Defense Dice

At any point in combat, ideally after taking a devastating hit, you can declare a Defensive Stance. This will allow you to roll your Defense Dice \(see Combat Reference Sheet\) to reduce the amount of damage taken every time you are hit until the end of your next turn. You roll the Defense Dice and retroactively reduce the damage to the devastating hit along with any other hit that comes at you.

The cost of this maneuver is your next Action Phase and is effectively protecting yourself at all costs. There is no limit to how often you do this, but you will not be taking any Actions while in this state.

## Grappling

This default in the combat skills is effectively there because anyone can attempt to wrestle, grapple, and fight for control. We build a minigame for this kind of play as it is dynamic and shifty.

A grapple is initiated by someone saying they are going to grapple the other, and starting it with a `d20 + Grapple vs d20 + Grapple`rolloff. 

Both characters will lose the following during the entire grapple:

* -2 Defense
* Loss of Movement Phase
* Loss of Action Phase \(unless you win the rolloff on your turn\)

The only way to get an action phase during a grapple is to win a `d20 + Grapple vs d20 + Grapple` rolloff on their turn. A rolloff must be done each turn a grappling combatant has.

Either character can choose to disengage the grapple if they win, regardless of whose turn it is.

Example:

`My character has chosen to grapple the enemy on his action. He does a rolloff of his grapple vs the enemies and loses. The enemy can choose to leave the grapple or stay in it. The enemy chooses to stay in it. The enemy turn comes around and they must roll the grapple rolloff again, the enemy wins and does an attack on my character because he won the grapple on his own turn. My character gets a turn, and we must grapple rolloff again, this time my character wins and decides he made a mistake grappling with him and ends the grapple.`

## Opportunity Attack

When a character leaves melee range in combat, the non-moving character will get one free attack at them as they leave. This may cause damage, but it does not in any way change your movement. This is just a single attack, not multiple attacks.

## Second Chance

Once per game session you can reroll anything at all. This includes combat rolls. Second Chance is a retroactive roll in reaction to a bad or disappointing outcome. Just dont forget to use it.

## Roleplay

Often overlooked in combat, roleplay elements could potentially overturn the outcome of combat. Maybe pulling on that loose ceiling struct might do something. Maybe you can talk your way out of combat. The key to OpenLore is roleplay is always present in the creative actions we take or the decisions we make. Combat is no exception to this and roleplay can be used to your advantage in many ways.
