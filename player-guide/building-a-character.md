# Building a Character

## Character Sheet

The character sheet has a list of all the proficiencies and characteristics needed to play the game.  
[http://character.openloregames.com ](http://character.openloregames.com)for the latest version of the character sheet. There is one in the back of the book as well for printing purpose.

## Steps to Creation

1. Think about the Character and print the Character Sheet
2. Put in your Player Name and Character Name
3. Assign a Race if needed \(_Aesthetic with Lore Implications Only_\)
4. Toggle Killable/NonKillable
5. Get 280 gold to start
6. Set Experience to 5, if Killable  set to 8
7. Write down the total Roleplay Skill Points and Combat Skill Points
8. Add a few sentences to Background
9. Add a few Personality words
10. Describe the character Appearance
11. Add any special Abilities the GM will allow
12. Create Roleplay Skills and assign Roleplay Skill Points
13. Create Combat Skills and assign Combat Skill Points
14. Get starter gear/equipment
15. Complete the combat reference sheet

That's it. You are done!

## Thinking about the Character

Creating the idea of your character is critical to the success of you character build in this system. You simply cannot create a character without a concept of how they interact with the world. The system relies on a few key components of a character to be successful. 

* How do you interact with friends, authority, enemies?
* How do you fight in combat?
* What are you good at? What would people come to you for?
* What are you bad at? How does this affect people around you?
* What do you look like?
* What is something in your past that defines you?

I cannot stress enough how important this is before getting started.

## Basic Information

### Player/Character Name

Player name is your own name.  
Character name is the name of the character you are playing.

### Race

Race is very different in OpenLore than in other systems. We do not provide racial bonuses of any kind. This is done specifically to provide significant freedom in character creation without stereotypes. You make a decision to be a specific race because of they way they fit in the lore and they way you want to play, not because they get a +2 to Strength.

## Killable and Non-Killable

This is whether you are willing to lose your character in game or not. Some roleplay players put immense amount of thought and diligence into their characters. These types of players can be hurt by the lose of the character in game. This mechanic puts the potential fate of the character into the hands of the player. A player decides whether or not his character can die and gets a significant boost if he does choose to play as a killable character.

A killable character gets 3 more initial experience points than a non-killable character.

If you have ever run a game you know that killing characters can be a burden to bear. This takes all the guilt of killing characters away from a GM and promotes the players being happy.

A Non-Killable character can only fall unconscious and never completely die. The GM is responsible for finding a way to save them, assuming the entire party does not perish.

## Experience

Experience is used to figure out how many Combat Skill Points and Roleplay Skill Points a character has. 

* Killable characters get **8** experience to start
* Non-Killable characters get **5** experience to start

Roleplay Skill Points are calculated with:   
\[ _Experience / 2 round down_ \]  
  
Combat Skill Points is simply:   
\[ _Experience_ \]

Experience is rewarded by the GM for quests, combats, or whatever the GM sees as appropriate to give it for. Experience sets key elements of the game.

* Combat Skill Points
* Roleplay Skill Points
* Maximum Combat Modifier
* Maximum Total Defense
* Enemy Difficulty
* Appropriate Loot

There is only a certain number of experience to distribute as a GM. If you go beyond the recommended maximum of 32 Experience max, you may start running into some strange math and probabilities. The difficulty tables in the appendix have been calibrated for a 32 Experience maximum.

The number of Experience given out per session will approximately throttle the number of sessions a campaign is played over. A GM should consider this in game planning and think about how many sessions he wants to make the campaign to be and what range of difficulty he wants his enemies to have.

## Detailed Information

### Background

Background should be written in short concise sentences defining the critical events taken place in your life. The background can describe why you have vises and virtues. It should also contain something the GM could potentially use in story writing.

### Personality

Personality should be a list of words describing temperament in social interactions of the character. These are personality traits you will be expect to act upon in roleplay situations.

### Appearance

Appearance is aesthetic but it is important in that it helps everyone see you in the theater of the mind.

### Abilities

Abilities are a category not every game is going to use. It is effectively a placeholder for traits not easily defined in the system. Examples might be Flying, or Infrared Vision, or something that gives you a clear advantage in role play and combat scenario. It is important to authorize these abilities with the GM and to fully describe them in the ability lines of the character sheet. Example:

> Infrared Vision, Ability to see heat instead of light. Can only see through non-solid surfaces.

> Read Minds, Ability to read a single person's mind. They will be aware this is happening.

> Telekenisis, Ability to move items less than your weight in your line of sight with your mind.

These must be approved by the GM and would be more appropriate in certain universes. There should be restrictions and limitations to these abilities.

## Roleplay Skill Points

_\[ Experience / 2 round down \]_

Roleplay skill points are skills that will help you in specific roleplay scenarios. These skills should be specific, not general. The skill `Athletics` should be  broken down to specifically `Climbing`. `Athletics` can apply to many scenarios, `Climbing` cannot. When making roleplay skills remember back to your definition of a character and make skills the meld with that vision.

These skills are not from a list, they are from your mind. Be creative and make them define who your character is. They can be skills with your hands, your mind, your social side, or something magical. They should only affect specific roleplay scenarios and these roleplay checks, generally will not help you in combat.

Some examples

```text
Climbing
Intimidation
Inventing
Flint Knapping
Deescalation
Haggle (default option on character sheets)
Sense Fear
...
...
```

The possibilities are endless and that is the point. Your own creativity is the limitation. Make sure they are not general and see the roleplay section of the book to see how to use roleplay skills.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All Roleplay Skills have a maximum of 10 points distributed to them. 
{% endhint %}

## Combat Skill Points

_\[ Experience \]_

Combat skills are skills that define what weapons and methods you are good at in combative situations. These are write in skills, and similar to roleplay skills, they should be specific not general. This should be discussed with the GM when building your character. Instead of `Two Handed Weapons` you would specify something more restrictive like `Great Axes`. This breaks the assumption that just because you use one two handed weapon you are skilled at using them all well. 

Some examples from a fantasy universe

```text
Unarmed (Martial Arts) (default option on character sheets)
Nunchucks
Great Axes
Bastard Swords
Short Bows
Sai
Scythe
Double Blades
Sickles
Chain Whip
Ice Magic
Gravity Magic
Plant Magic
```

This list could be endless and only limited by imagination. It is important to understand how you character fights in combat to be able to pick these. These skills will be used to calculate the damage done and how often you hit an enemy. It is recommended to keep these very narrow focused and not spread out your points too much.

There are several other Combat Skills beyond the written in weapon based skills.

| Skill | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Grapple | Assigns Defense - 2, Lose Action, Lose Movement to both grapplers. If winner succeeds a d20 + Grapple vs d20 + Grapple rolloff on his own turn he can use his action. Only the winner can assert the grapple is over. |
| Toughness | Used to increase your health points by 2 each skill point |
| Aim | Aim is used for increasing the maximum range you are capable of using. This range is the max distance possible even if the weapon has a greater range. |
| Self-Defense | Ability to defend self through technique, whether it be dodging, parrying, or blocking. This is taken by characters that don't want as much armor and gains Defense + 2 per skill point |
| Tactics | Used for the effect system, more of this provides both Effect defense and offense |
| Speed | Used to increase movement in combat |
| First Aid | Skill applying first aid to heal wounds, touch only if not magical |

Each of these Combat Skills make a significant difference in combat. Your points are worth spending in this area as these skills directly interact with combat. The Combat Reference Sheet is designed to make these combat skills easily translatable in combat and we will discuss that later in this section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All Combat Skills have a maximum of 10 points distributed to them.
{% endhint %}

## Starting Gear

You will be given 280 gold to build your character. Each +1 item is 100g and a gear kit is 50g. In theory this means you will have two +1 pieces of equipment and a gear pack with 30g remaining. If you wanted a +2 item, it would be 200g. There are no custom kits at Character Creation, just keep it simple, roleplay will provide plenty of opportunity to buy whatever you want.

| Dungeon Kit | Adventure Kit | Noble Kit | Buglar Kit | ??? Kit |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stuff | Stuff | Stuff | Stuff | Stuff |  |  |  |  |
| Thing | Thing | Thing | Thing | Thing |  |  |  |  |
| Neat | Neat | Neat | Neat | Neat |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

You will notice that there are equipment sizes on the Character Sheet. This is how the system handles encumbrance. You are only allowed to carry 3 large, 5 medium, and 7 small sized items. Large Size is typically an Armor Set or Large Weapon, Medium Size is most general weapons or a bedroll size, Small Size is daggers, candles, trinkets, etc,

When purchasing the starting gear write them into the appropriate size slots noting the Defense or CM bonus. Your GM can make a decision on where to put them if it is unclear what slot it would take.

 Example Items: 

```text
Masterwork Shortsword, CM+5
Worn Leather Armor, Def+1
Spiked Steel Kicking Shoes, Def+1, CM+1
```

Not all equipment will have modifiers. Torches, Rations, Ball Bearings, Lockpicks, etcetera will not have modifiers on them. The GM will decided what slot these should take for size. See Economics in the Story part of this book.

## Combat Reference Sheet

This sheet was designed to have all the data you will need in combat scenarios. It can be found in the back of this book or at [http://character.openloregames.com](http://character.openloregames.com) on the second page. This reference sheet does not have any direct input and is a product of the Character Sheet choices. 

### Weapons

You should start filling this sheet out by defining the weapons. Typically these will be weapons you purchased as part of your build and will correlate with a combat skill you chose. An example would be the weapon name of `Standard Bastard Sword, CM+2` would correlate to the combat skill called `Bastard Swords [5]`. For this description we can say that this character has the combat skill Bastard Sword with 5 skill points in it.

The first step to add the Bastard Sword to the reference sheet is to write in the weapon name of `Standard Bastard Sword` then you need to figure out the Combat Dice for this weapon. The Combat Dice are figured out by looking at the table below \(also on the combat reference sheet\)

The next step is to calculate the Combat Modifier, this is simply the Combat Skill,`Bastard Swords [5]` + the CM bonus of the equipment `Standard Bastard Sword, CM+2` In this case we get 5 from the Skill and 2 from the equipment.

Next we have to figure out the Combat Modifier Max, this stat is to throttle the progression of the characters and enemies to keep balance throughout the game. We will say this character has **13** Experience. Reference the following table to see what the maximum for the current experience is.

| Experience | Max Total Defense | Max Combat Modifier |
| ---: | :---: | :--- |
| 5-7 | 12 | 2 |
| 8-10 | 14 | 4 |
| 11-13 | 16 | 6 |
| 14-16 | 18 | 8 |
| 17-19 | 20 | 10 |
| 20-22 | 22 | 12 |

In this case the Maximum Combat Modifier is **6.** We write this down in the field and continue. You will need to work with you GM and the table to talk about what you think the minimum and maximum range of that weapon should be. Most melee combat weapons for example like a Bastard Sword, would be **1** square Weapon Range Minimum and **1** Weapon Range Maximum. 

The next step is to figure out what combat dice to use for your weapon. The following table is based on the lower Combat Modifier. In the example above, the Bastard Swords skill of 5 and the Equipment `Standard Bastard Sword CM + 2` would make a total CM for the `Standard Bastard Sword` of **7**. As we calculated in the previous step the _Maximum Combat Modifier_ for this character is **6**. We always use the lower value between these two in combat, and we use the lower value in figuring out your combat dice. In this case, the Maximum is the lower value, referencing the table a 6 is the combat dice **1d6+1d8**.

| Combat Modifier | Dice |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0-3 | 1d4+1d8 |
| 4-7 | 1d6+1d8 |
| 8-11 | 1d6+1d10 |
| 12-15 | 1d8+1d10 |
| 16-19 | 1d8+1d12 |
| 20 | 1d10+1d12 |

The range of the weapons is negotiable based on common sense. Range units are in squares. A polearm for example would be **2** min, **2** max range. These weapon ranges could vary from weapon to weapon. Two short bows could have different ranges for example. This part of the game is open and will take guidance from you GM. 

Character Range is the last piece to figure out in the Weapon section of the reference sheet. Character Range is the amount the character is able to Aim accurately. This uses the Aim combat skill from the character sheet + 2. So if this character had put **2** points into Aim, his character range would be **5.** 

As you can see in the reference sheet, there are dotted lines dividing sections of the sheet. Combat Modifier and Combat Modifier Max for example are divided that way. This means that you use the lowest value. In our Bastard Sword example, the Combat Modifier is **7** _\[5 skill + 2 equipment\]_, but the Max Combat Modifier is only **6,** this means we would use the lower value of **6** in combat.

The same goes for Character Range vs Weapon Range Max, use the lower value.

### Calculated Stats

This next section on the reference sheet is for all the remaining combat skills. This is where you can start to see how those points change combat. You will notice on the Calculated Stats portion of the Combat Reference Sheet that there is a Total and a Max column. Most of the Max fields have values already, this is just the max number calculated if there was 10 points \(max possible\) in that skill.

### Total Defense Max

Total Defense Max is the only field you will have to look up for. This, just like Combat Modifier, has a maximum based on experience. Reference the same table above to find what the max Total Defense is for you Experience. 

In the example above with **13** Experience, the Total Defense Max is **16.** In this same example let's say the person has some `Leather Armor, Def+2`, some `Small Shield, Def+2` and `Self-Defense [2]` ****. Since Self-Defense is **2** Defense per point, we get **4** Defense from the Self-Defense skill and **4** Defense from our equipment, we just add the _Base 10_ to the number and we get a Total Defense of **18.** Since the Total Defense Max is **16**, that is the defense we would use for combat ****

### **Defense Dice**

In combat you have the option to choose to lose you next action in trade for damage reduction. This damage reduction is quantified by a dice roll. This dice roll, just like Combat Dice, is located on a table. In the running example the Total Defense was **18.** Referencing the table below you will see this results in a Defense Dice of `1d6+1d8`. 

| Total Defense | Dice |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10-13 | 1d4+1d6 |
| 14-17 | 1d4+1d8 |
| 18-21 | 1d6+1d8 |
| 22-25 | 1d6+1d10 |
| 26-29 | 1d8+1d10 |
| 30 | 1d8+1d12 |

The Total Defense we used is the calculated total, not the Max Total Defense. This makes it so you get a marginal benefit from having a Total Defense over the Maximum. There will be more details about Defense Dice in the Combat section of the book.

### Tactics

This is on the Combat Reference Sheet as a reference, it is brought straight over from the Character Sheet. Tactics are used to modify the dice roll used to see if an effect takes place against and enemy or not. More details on this in the Combat section of the book.

#### Effect Points

These are used to choose the effects you are capable of doing. To calculate these you do `Tactics / 2 round down + 1` The points range from 1-6 total and limit the effects done in combat. 

Effect Points are used on the following table during combat.

| Effect Name | Effect Buff / Debuff | Duration Possibilities | Tactical Point Cost |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Attack |  +/- Effect Points | 2 Rounds or Concentration | 1 |
| Defense |  +/- Effect Points | 2 Rounds or Concentration | 1 |
| Damage |  +/- Effect Points | 2 Rounds or Concentration | 1 |
| Speed |  +/- Effect Points | 2 Rounds or Concentration | 1 |
| Tactics |  +/- Effect Points | 2 Rounds or Concentration | 1 |
| Movement Phase | Prevent Removal / Remove Movement Phase | 1 Round or Concentration | 2 |
| Action Phase | Prevent Removal / Remove Action Phase | 1 Round or Concentration | 3 |

### Healing

First Aid skill makes Healing better. Healing is touch based unless magical somehow. Healing is calculated simply by `3 x First Aid + 5` which means that a character with 0 skill in First Aid can still heal by 5 health. There is more details about health in the Combat section of the book.

### Movement

When the Movement Phase of combat comes around on your turn you can move up to this many squares on the battle map. The formula for this is simply `Speed + 3` meaning the base speed in combat is just 3 squares. Just like other sections here, there is more detail on movement in the Combat section.

### Character Range

Character Range, as discussed before in the Weapons section, limits the max usable range based on the character. It is basically saying, just because your weapon can shoot 500 yards, does not mean you have the talent to aim that precisely. Character range is calculated simply be `Aim + 2` and the lower value between Character Range and Weapon Range Max is used in combat situations.
