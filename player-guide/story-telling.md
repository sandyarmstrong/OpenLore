# Story and Roleplay

## What a Roleplaying Game is most...

It is a story, a tragedy, a fantastic adventure, a futuristic tale, a true to life epic... Roleplaying games at their core are really just a grand `Choose your own Adventure Book` inside the mind of the Game Master. It is the only game type you can make decisions that truly affect the story and truly have consequences. It is the only game style that is imagination driven where literally anything can happen.

Story mode is when you are out of combat. This is where dialog occurs, puzzles, dungeoneering, purchasing, discovery, plot, etcetera occur. Story mode typically is about half a game session. The ratio of story vs combat is something a GM will handle in their own way. The combats that take place should make sense in the story context.

"I want to push the thingy mabober!" -says player X.

Yes, that happens time to time in a roleplaying game and as such needs a mechanic to handle it and the many other scenarios that come up while playing out the diabolical plot the Game Master has provided. The roleplay check is the answer to all these story mode scenarios.

## Roleplay Checks

When you really want to do something in OpenLore, there is a roleplay check that occurs to see if you pull it off. OpenLore takes a drastically different and simplified perspective on this key element to any roleplaying game. Rather than list every possible skill and track them, the Game Master simply assigns a number on a d20 that the player has to beat based on the 'average person' in the world and the context of the situation.

The real beauty about the system is it keeps the game under the Game Masters control, while still giving people the power to imagine and devise interesting characters and roleplay. The max difficulty of a situation is 20, and the lowest is 1. In other words, you get a 5% chance to fail or succeed outlier conditions even when you are just average at a task.

Roleplay Skills \(see Building a Character\) are a way for characters to be better than average at something and they add directly to the d20 roll in attempt to beat the 'average' difficulty set by the GM.

### The Pit Example 

`We have a character that has 4 points in Jumping. The Game Master requires that the party needs to jump over a pit. The Game Master will announce "You must beat a 10" because you know, its kind of a big pit. The player then rolls an 8 on his/her d20, adds her 4 points in Jumping and successfully gets over the pit.   
  
The next character has no such additional skill in Jumping. He too is required to jump over the pit, rolls 11 on his dice, adds nothing to his roll, and still succeeds to beat the 10 roll required by the GM.  
  
The last character that is up to jump the gap decides he is uninterested in the risk of insecurely jumping over the pit and spots a nice place to hook a grappling hook into the ceiling. He then claims he wants to simply swing over the gap. The Game Master takes this into context of how he/she feels about the situation and asks the player to see how well the grappling hook holds, and how well he can swing. The Game Master states, "You need to roll over a 5 to make sure the grappled rock holds your weight and you successfully make it over" but the player rolls a 3! indicating he was wrong about the sturdiness of the rock he grabbed with the hook.  
  
Now, suddenly, the party must take action to save him via more roleplay checks until the situation is resolved or the killable character is dead at the bottom of the pit.`

### Haggle and Mini-games

Haggle is a built in Roleplay check that demonstrates the mini-game possibilities. Haggle is a skill that can be used in basically every universe so it was perfect to use as a sample.

Haggle operates by giving the entire party 3 chances to haggle prices down at a vendor. You are not required to use all three attempts. A single person can use all 3 attempts, or they can be attempted by multiple people.

Haggle works by adjusting a d20 roll with the haggle roleplay skill vs the vendors d20 and haggle skill. 

* Success - the prices at the vendor change 10% in favor of the party \(+10% selling / -10% buying\)
* Failure - the prices at the vendor change 10% in detriment of the party \(+10% selling / -10% buying\)

Mini-games are a great way to fit complex mechanics into the game with simple d20, or d20 rolloff situations. See Grapple in the Combat Mode section for another combat oriented mini-game.

## Shenanigans

Shenanigans is a rule put into place by which players can diplomatically and quickly resolve roleplaying disagreements. The process is simple.

1. A player calls Shenanigans during the roleplay story mode part of the game
2. Play pauses and the caller of Shenanigans explains what he disagrees with in a sentence or two
3. The person who made the statement defends himself and his own logic in a sentence or two
4. The remaining people at the table get an opportunity to pitch a sentence or two
5. A vote is cast, Game Master is the tie breaker if needed

This rule is universal and can be used any time something "Doesnt seem to make sense" or "Doesnt seem lore appropriate" or "Doesnt make for a fun game" 

#### Example

`As a Game Master of a High Fantasy game, I say "Then an atomic bomb goes off in the middle of Isaldor."   
  
A player will very likely feel like that is lore inappropriate and just doesnt make sense, so he/she calls Shenanigans. The person says "There are no atomic weapons in our world, that doesnt make sense" and the Game Master says "I like atomic weapons though... " and the last player says, "Yah I dont think that makes sense, maybe it could be some magical explosion or something?" The players then take a vote and out vote the Game Master 2-1, the Game Master then must retract the Atomic Bomb Explosion from the story.`

I use the Game Master example for a reason, the Shenanigans rule is effectively a cooperative rule to keep the game in a place that makes sense to the majority of people in the game. It is a method to help explain miscues and things that may be an innocent misunderstanding.

Shenanigans can be used on any roleplay element of the game done by any person in the game, player or  game master alike.

## Economics

Gold is the general unit of currency, but this can be retrofit to your universe just by changing the name. There are 10 levels of quality for equipment in the game and each quality goes up by 100 gold.

The other items and services bought in the world follow this model of having a range of qualities. The specific items are not listed so much as the quality. This allows for anything imaginable in your universe, you just have to choose the quality and the type to figure out the cost. You can fit almost anything into this simple table.

| Quality | Housing | Transportation | Services | Entertainment | Useful Goods | Food | Cheapest |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Basic | 1000 | 200 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 2 | 1 |
| Good | 4000 | 800 | 400 | 80 | 40 | 8 | 4 |
| Best | 16000 | 3200 | 1600 | 320 | 160 | 32 | 16 |

The GM can make fine tuning adjustments on the fly but this table offers stability and predictability to financial decisions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a GM wants to run a more specific economics system he/she can spend the time needed to create the list of items and costs for the universe they want to play in. There are usually lists of items and services including costs associated with most universe materials. Campaign Settings will generally have this data. Online can be be a great resource for this to find the prices on various specific items.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Another easy alternative method for economics is just ask how much it would cost in the real world and convert it one to one to gold. Pitons are $10 on amazon, therefor they are 10g in game. A grappling hook on amazon is $30, so 30g in game. Beer is $2, so 2g in game. A decent hotel is $150 a night, therefor the same quality inn would be 150g. This economic system works great for just about everything that is gear or services based. Keep equipment quality based prices at 100g per quality tier and it all works out.
{% endhint %}

## Treasure/Quest Rewards

Treasure and Quest rewards work by setting the value of the loot based on the experience. Refer to the `Individual Player Loot by Experience` table at [http://master.openloregames.com](http://master.openloregames.com) for value suggestions. When the reward occurs the GM will use your experience on the table and reward you individually with that amount of worth.

Referencing the chart, at experience 10 for a Hard quest, the reward is either 300g in items or a single Well-Made piece of equipment.

## Jail Time and Criminals

Jail time and criminal activity is handled in a pretty straight forward way. OpenLore offers GMs a very simple system to arrest, detain and release criminals in a game. Experience is taken away, a fine is paid in gold or equipment, and story affecting time will pass. The GM may decide that player may need to roll a new character if they commit a crime to continue playing while the old character is incarcerated.

When you are caught by guards, which will likely happen sooner than later, you will have the choice to fight or be taken in. If you choose to be taken in your sentencing will be halved for good deeds. If you choose to fight you will be fighting one bounty hunter per person in the party. The difficulty of these bounty hunters will be the `Criminal's experience + Hunter Experience` in the crime table. If you win, each fighting member will be charged with additional charges based on the state you leave the bounty hunters in. 

The party may choose to turn you in, thereby avoiding getting criminal charges put on their own heads trying to protect you. It is up to the GM how easy it is to get away from the guards and to keep crimes secret. The system in which jail time is handed out is up to the GM, whether it be a trial or just a decision.

Here are some suggested jail times, the fine and the time suggested. These can be adjusted freely or be taken as a simple universal standard.

| Crime | Months in Jail | Gold Fee | Experience Atrophy | Hunter Experience + |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stealing | 1 | 100 | 1 | 1 |
| Aiding a Criminal | 1 | 200 | 1 | 1 |
| Grand Theft | 2 | 400 | 1 | 2 |
| Alteration | 3 | 500 | 2 | 2 |
| Pillaging | 4 | 600 | 2 | 3 |
| Assault | 5 | 700 | 2 | 3 |
| Manslaughter | 6 | 800 | 3 | 4 |
| Homicide | 12 | 1000 | 6 | 5 |

Jail times and Experience Atrophy are the same regardless of how many charges there are. The gold fee is a per crime fee. Example, if you have 2 counts of Grand Theft, the penalty total would be 2x400g \(800 gold\), 2 months in prison and 1 Exp. point.
